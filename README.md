# ModelChecker
Formal verification of a student scholarship application system using UPPAAL. Models real-time behavior of login, application, transcript retrieval, and decision-making based on CGPA and income. Ensures safety (no deadlocks, valid application logic) and liveness (eventual transitions like login/logout), verified via temporal logic queries.
